  about:
    "Hi there! My name is Jason, and I am a 11th standard student. I love going to school and learning new things every day. My favourite subject is maths, and I enjoy playing with my friends during breaks. I am also very keen on learning more about science and history. In my free time, I like to read books and play football. I always try my best in everything I do, both in and out of the classroom. I am looking forward to a great year ahead!",
